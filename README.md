# Startup Name Generator

> Inspired by [this pen](https://codepen.io/rstacruz/full/wJyaJb), I tried to implement the startup name generator mobile app.

**Logic for generating startup names**

I have used [Startup Name Generator Library](https://github.com/rstacruz/startup-name-generator) by [@rstacruz](https://github.com/rstacruz/) for the same.

Please note that this app is just for fun, I created this to pass my free time. Given below are the steps to install it, have fun ðŸ™Œ

## Steps to run

- Clone or download this repository
- Go to the project root directory and open terminal/cmd
- Install `expo-cli` as a global dependency, `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Install the project dependencies:  `npm install`
- `npm start` will open up the Expo Dev Tools, scan the QR Code and you are good to go :)

## To Do

- [x] Implement the app logic (used the startup name generator library)
- [x] Make a basic app which runs the app logic (takes input and displays startup names)
- [ ] Style part 1: Apply basic styling to make the app look good
- [ ] Style part 2: Add more advances animations to make the app look more good

## Screenshots

Will add them once I apply basic styling, the app UI is very bad currently :P
